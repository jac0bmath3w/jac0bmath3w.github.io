In this post, I talk about my attempt to find the optimal strategy to maximize the score in a dice game. 

##  The Game

You roll a fair 10-sided die.

- If you roll a **10**, the game ends, and you win **nothing**.
- If you roll **1â€“9**, you gain that many dollars and can **choose to stop or continue**.
- However, you are **not allowed to stop** until your total reaches at least **$10**.

How do you play this game optimally?

## ðŸ§ª Strategy 1: Random Play

I first tried a randomized strategy â€” once I reached $10, I continued with 50% probability:

```python
play_again = random.uniform(0, 1) < 0.5
