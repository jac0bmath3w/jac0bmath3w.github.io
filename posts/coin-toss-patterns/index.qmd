In this post, I talk about how to find the expected value of the number of coin tosses needed to find a specific pattern for the first time. 

##  The Setup

You toss a fair coin until you reach a specific pattern. Example HH. How many tosses would you need on an average to get to this pattern for the first time. 


---

## Solution

To tackle this problem, I thought about the solution in terms of conditional probability.

Given that I have not seen the pattern yet, if the last toss was an H, how many more tosses can I expect before I see the pattern? Call this H.
Given that I have not seen the pattern yet, if the last toss was a T, how many more tosses can I expect before I see the pattern? Call this T. 

$$
H = 0.5*1 + 0.5*(1+T)
$$

The explanation of the equation above is, as follows:
Given that we have not seen the pattern yet, and we tossed an H, with 0.5 probability we can get the pattern. With another 0.5 probability we need (1+T). 1 because of the T we just rolled, and T is the expected number given the last toss was T.

$$
T = 0.5(1+H) + 0.5(1+T)
$$

We now have a system of linear equations. On solving this, we get $$H = 4$$, $$T = 6$$ and $$E = 6$$

## Expanding Further

What if we have
1. A pattern HHH?
2. Unfair dice?
3. Is the expected value to get HHH the same as HTH? What about TTH?
