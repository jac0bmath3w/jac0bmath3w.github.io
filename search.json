    "text": "Strategy 2: Optimized Play\nAt this point, I asked myself can I calculate at each turn (after reaching a score of 10) can I calculate what my score could be after the next roll.\nSay, my score is 10, what possible values can my score take if I roll the die again?\n\n\n\nDice Throw Outcome\nNew Score\nProbability\n\n\n\n\n1\n11\n\\(1/10\\)\n\n\n2\n12\n\\(1/10\\)\n\n\n3\n13\n\\(1/10\\)\n\n\n4\n14\n\\(1/10\\)\n\n\n5\n15\n\\(1/10\\)\n\n\n6\n16\n\\(1/10\\)\n\n\n7\n17\n\\(1/10\\)\n\n\n8\n18\n\\(1/10\\)\n\n\n9\n19\n\\(1/10\\)\n\n\n10\n0\n\\(1/10\\)\n\n\n\nThis means, my expected value at the end of the throw is \\[\n\\sum_{i=11}^{19} \\frac{i}{10} = 13.5\n\\]\nThis is a value greater than my current score. So, it makes sense for me to play the game once more.\nSo I updated my strategy as such.\ndef strategy(res):\n    e = 0\n    for i in range(1, 10):\n        e += (res + i) / 10\n\n    return e &gt; res\nWhat this does is ask the following question. Given my current score, do I expect a higher score if I play again?\nAt first, this confused me — res + i increases as res increases, so why does the gain shrink?\nTurns out, the math reveals:\n\\[E(res)=0.9res+4.5⇒E(res)−res=−0.1res+4.5\\]\nSo as x increases, the value of rolling decreases linearly. Once x reaches 45, the expected gain is 0. Beyond that, rolling again is actually worse than stopping."
